# Python Socket Chatroom

A simple multi-client Client-Server chatroom application using Python sockets and threading.

## Features

- Username authentication (unique)
- Private messaging between users (`/pm <username> <message>`)
- List all online users (`/list`)
- Show available commands (`/option`)
- Get your own info (`/whoami`)
- File transfer TCP

## Future 
- Chat room requests (Accept/Deny by Admin/Server?) 
- Admin system (admin password, admin requests)
- Admin command (/kick, /mute, /all bs?)
- Message encryption

This project is for educational purposes and demonstrates basic socket programming and multi-threaded server/client design in Python.
